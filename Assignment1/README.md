About the big o notation for each of the equation logarithmic is the best. O(log n) is preferable. The maximum running time of the algorithm is proportional to the logarithm of the input size. The maximum running time of the method is proportional to the size of the input. As a result, O(logn) is more compact than others, and it also performs better in terms of algorithm analysis.
